# Solving the Incomplete Markets Model Using the Krusell-Smith and Reiter Methods
Matlab code and guide for solving the incomplete markets model using the methods of Krusell &amp; Smith (1998) and Reiter (2009).

Running Start.m solves the model using both methods, and produces the figures in the [note](https://github.com/sebgraves/KS_and_Reiter/blob/master/Reiter_KS.pdf).

The [Sims (2001) gensys toolbox](http://sims.princeton.edu/yftp/gensys/) and the [Miranda & Fackler CompEcon toolbox](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~pfackler/compecon/toolbox.html) are both required.
